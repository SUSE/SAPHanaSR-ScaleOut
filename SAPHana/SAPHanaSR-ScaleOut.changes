- change version to 0.180.1
- Multi-target SAP HANA Scale-out replication support.
  Extent the SAP HANA ressource agents from single replication
  automation to multi replication automation, which means
  adding multi-target support (srHook - SAPHanaSrMultiTarget.py)
  /usr/sbin/SAPHanaSR-manageAttr - Add a helper tool to support the
  customer during the update from a single replication automation
  to multi replication automation.
  (jsc#SLE-20081)
- The resource start and stop timeout is now configurable by
  increasing the timeout for the action 'start' and/or 'stop' in
  the cluster. We will use 95% of this action timeouts to calculate
  the new resource start and stop timeout for the 'WaitforStarted'
  and 'WaitforStopped' functions. If the new, calculated timeout
  value is less than '3600', it will be set to '3600', so that we
  do not decrease this timeout by accident in currently running
  clusters
  (bsc#1182545)
- improve handling of return codes in saphana_stopSystem and
  saphana_stop function.
  (bsc#1182115)
- If the cluster is down during a SR change event, these events
  need special care. They need to pick-up separately to not get
  lost.
- integrate man pages back to the base package SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut.
  The doc package SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-doc will still exists, but
  only contain the file 'SAPHanaSR-Setup-Guide.pdf'
- During a SR takeover there may be a small time frame where the
  srHook gets a state change from the API with an empty site name.
  This results in a mis-configuration of the cluster. So log the
  occurrence of an empty site name, but do not generate bad
  formatted cluster attribute name.
  (analog to ScaleUp - bsc#1173581)
- add SAPHanaSR-call-monitor
- handle 'leftover instances'
  if HANA is configured to have only one master name server, but
  no additional master name server candidates, there may be the
  situation, where the master name serve died and so the landscape
  has no active name server anymore.
  But there are other instances running with active communication
  channels. To prevent data corruption or operations on outdated
  data, we identify and stop these 'leftover' instances.
- manual page updates:
  SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut.7 (bsc#1144442)
  SAPHanaSR-showAttr.8 (bsc#1144312)
  and others
