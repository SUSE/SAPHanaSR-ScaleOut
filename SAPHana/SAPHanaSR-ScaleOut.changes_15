    different behaviour of 'crmadmin -q -S' in different pacemaker
    versions
    (bsc#1217830)
  * inside SAPHanaSR-hookHelper use the full path for the cibadmin
    command to support non root users in special user environments
    (bsc#1216484)
  * if the SAPHanaSrMultiTarget hook has successfully reported a
    SR event to the cluster a still existing fall-back state file
    will be removed to prevent an override of an already reported
    SR state.
    (bsc#1215693)
  * update man pages:
    SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut.7
    SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut_basic_cluster.7

Mon Aug 25 16:24:32 UTC 2023 - abriel@suse.com

- Version bump to 0.185.1
  * improve supportability by providing the current process ID of
    the RA, which is logged in the RA outputs, to HANA tracefiles
    too.
    This allows a mapping of the SAP related command invocations
    from the RA and the HANA executions which might have a delay
    in between.
    (bsc#1214613)
  * modify /tmp full fix
    (bsc#1210728)
  * update man pages:
    SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut.7
  * add improvements from SAP to the RA scripts, part II
    (jsc#PED-1739, jsc#PED-2608)

    examples to be useful
    (bsc#1210573)

Tue Nov 29 17:13:37 UTC 2022 - abriel@suse.com

- Version bump to 0.184.1
  * add new HA/DR provider hook susChkSrv supporting a fast-dying
    indexserver
    (jsc#PED-1241, jsc#PED-1240)
  * add new HA/DR provider hook susTkOver for blocking manual
    takeovers
    (jsc#SLE-16347)
  * add improvements from SAP to the RA scripts regarding the
    handling of the SAP tools 'HDB version', 'HDBSettings.sh' and
    'pycd' and the SAPHana log filter handling
    (jsc#PED-1739, jsc#PED-2608)
  * fix SAPHanaSR-replay-archive to handle hb_report archives again
    (bsc#1198897)
  * fix for SAPHanaSR-monitor reporting "LPA status of one node is
    missing"
    (bsc#1192963, bsc#1203973)
  * add lost-nameserver-slave handling to SAPHanaTopology, to avoid
    toggeling SAPHanaController resource, if all nameserver-masters
    got lost.
    SAPHanaController keeps started, if WAITING4NODES event needs
    to be processed. This only keeps the resource "started".
    The SAP HANA instance will only be started, if enough nodes are
    available to fulfill the needs of the SAP HANA landscape.
  * add new tool SAPHanaSR-manageProvider to show, add and delete
    HA/DR provider sections in the global.ini of SAP HANA.
  * changes to the demote_clone function of the resource agent:
    if the role is '*:shtdown:shtdown:shtdown' (topology agent run
    into timeouts) the function fail with rc=1, to get the managed
    resource stopped
    changes to the stop_clone function of the topology agent:
    call landscapeHostConfiguration.py and set the roles as they
    were reported. If the command timed out, set the role to
    '*:shtdown:shtdown:shtdown' and return 1 to get the node
    fenced.
    The used timeout for the landscapeHostConfiguration.py call can
    be configured by the cluster action timeout, if needed. It will
    be 50% of the action timeout or the minimum of 300s.
    (bsc#1198127)
  * SAPHanaSRTools.pm: shows terminate node attribute too
  * change SAPHanaSR-manageAttr to support the different behaviour
    of 'crmadmin -qD' in different pacemaker versions
    (bsc#1200969)
  * fix HANA_CALL function to support MCOS environments again
    (bsc#1198780)
  * correct the order constraint in man page
    ocf_suse_SAPHanaTopology.7
    (bsc#1197239)

Mon Jan 10 09:57:21 UTC 2022 - abriel@suse.com

- change version to 0.181.0
- Add systemd support for the resource agent to interact with the
  new SAP unit files for sapstartsrv.
  As the new version of the SAP Startup Framework will use systemd
  unit files to control the sapstartsrv process instead of the  
  previous used SysV init script, we need to adapt the handling of
  sapstartsrv inside the resource agents to support both ways.
  (bsc#1189532, bsc#1189533)
- add dedicated logging of HANA_CALL problems. So it will be now
  possible to identify, if the called hana command or the needed
  su command throws the error and for further hints we log the
  stderr output.
  Additional it is possible to get regular log messages for the
  used commands, their return code and their stderr output by
  enabling the 'debug' mode of the resource agents.
  (bsc#1182774)
- add switch 'cib_access' to the SAPHanaSrMultiTarget hook to give
  control over the hook runtime.
  Default is 'all-on' which means there are 3 cib calls performed
  inside the hook script.
  Changing the value of 'cib_access' inside the global.ini file to
  'site-on' to perform the absolute minimum cib calls (only one)
  (bsc#1189540)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug  2 12:23:09 UTC 2021 - abriel@suse.com

- change version to 0.180.1
- Multi-target SAP HANA Scale-out replication support.
  Extent the SAP HANA ressource agents from single replication
  automation to multi replication automation, which means
  adding multi-target support (srHook - SAPHanaSrMultiTarget.py)
  /usr/sbin/SAPHanaSR-manageAttr - Add a helper tool to support the
  customer during the update from a single replication automation
  to multi replication automation.
  (jsc#SLE-17452, jsc#SLE-20081)
- The resource start and stop timeout is now configurable by
  increasing the timeout for the action 'start' and/or 'stop' in
  the cluster. We will use 95% of this action timeouts to calculate
  the new resource start and stop timeout for the 'WaitforStarted'
  and 'WaitforStopped' functions. If the new, calculated timeout
  value is less than '3600', it will be set to '3600', so that we
  do not decrease this timeout by accident in currently running
  clusters
  (bsc#1182545)
- improve handling of return codes in saphana_stopSystem and
  saphana_stop function.
  (bsc#1182115)
- If the cluster is down during a SR change event, these events
  need special care. They need to pick-up separately to not get
  lost.
- integrate man pages back to the base package SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut.
  The doc package SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-doc will still exists, but
  only contain the file 'SAPHanaSR-Setup-Guide.pdf'
- During a SR takeover there may be a small time frame where the
  srHook gets a state change from the API with an empty site name.
  This results in a mis-configuration of the cluster. So log the
  occurrence of an empty site name, but do not generate bad
  formatted cluster attribute name.
  (analog to ScaleUp - bsc#1173581)
- add SAPHanaSR-call-monitor
- handle 'leftover instances'
  if HANA is configured to have only one master name server, but
  no additional master name server candidates, there may be the
  situation, where the master name server died and so the landscape
  has no active name server anymore.
  But there are other instances running with active communication
  channels. To prevent data corruption or operations on outdated
  data, we identify and stop these 'leftover' instances.
- add workaround for 'sapcontrol -function WaitforStopped'
  terminating to early.
  If the master name server dies and does not have a failover
  candidate but there are still running worker nodes the command
  'sapcontrol -function WaitforStopped' terminates to early and
  does not wait till all the remaining worker nodes are down.
  So the resource agent needs to wait during his 'stopSystem'
  function till the last "partial" node is down before returning
  a result to the cluster.
